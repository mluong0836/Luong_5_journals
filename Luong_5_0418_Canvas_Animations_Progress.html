                <li> I have made significant progress on my animations. From just a blinking circle</br>
                     I was able to create multiple circles that slightly overlap each other. Although, this might not </br>
                     seem interesting at first sight, there is a lot of animations going on in the background. </br>
                     For example, I was able to make three "skinny" ovals that would appear every 5 seconds through a </br>
                     for loop that would increase 3 every three seconds. In addition, there are faint movements of light </br>
                     that would dance. Furthermore, these lines also draw a small picture near the right corner, which </br>
                     will first build itself up until it reaches 90 pixels and then decrease until it reaches zero pixels.</br>
                     All in all, my art showed layers of animations embedded in the wild main animation. </br></li>
                
                <li> In javascript, a function is similar to a method in Java in which in holds a set of codes that will</br>
                     run when called upon within the main loop. Therefore, the purpose of a function is to "encapsulate"</br>
                     a series of codes that could be called upon multiple times; thus, saving time, space, and is more </br>
                     efficient. In other words, a function is a block of code that performs a specific thing coded </br>
                     within the specified function just called. It performs the task needed. </br></li>
                
                <li> I have created multiple functions. For example, I created an onload function which loads the </br>
                     necessary variables. For example, I declared several global variables and this onload function</br>
                     serves to hold the overaching javascript file. Therefore, it will run when it is loaded. In </br>
                     addition, another function that I created was the draw function, which will draw all of the rects </br>
                     and lines on the actual canvas. Lastly, the final function was the animating function, which is </br>
                     where I coded the rotations, x and y movements, and scaling factors. </br> </li>
