              <li> We are redoing this project because most of our classmates had a difficult time linking the five directories</br>
                  , and their webpages didn't show the amount of work/effort that was expected of a week and a half of work. My webpage</br>
                  came out fine although if I had time I could have included some hover effects.</li>
                  
              <li> All my links work and are successful at linking webpages from different directories without breaking. Somethings that </br>
                   that I could tweak would be the use of animations to make my webpage look authentic and realistic. I will attempt to </br>
                   make the colors more appealing. In other words, I am more focused on the designs and style more than the actual site </br>
                   itself, since I know that my previous webpage was successful.</li>
