		<p> Some animation effects that css can perform includes fades, transitions of different colors, bounce effect, and spinning effects as well. For instance,
		    we see the transition effects when we transition from one page to the next on a website. Furthermore, we can see color changes and image rotations. In addition,
                    the bounce effect occurs when the image, header, etc... seems to appear closer as you hover over the element/text.</p>
		
		<p> The transition effects allows the user to easily navigate through the rest of the webpage or see an element closer. For instance, when you hover your mouse
                    over that paticular element, the element, such as the header, will either expand itself persuading you to examine it/click on it. These transitions create
                    a better appeal to the user. </p>
