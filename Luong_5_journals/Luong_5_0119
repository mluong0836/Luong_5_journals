                  <li> I did not do the reviews because I was busy on the datacon webpages. The datacon website is going great 
                        </br> I have had a lot of progress lately. It took quite awhile trying to decipher the already </br>
                        provided codes.</li>
                        
                  <li> Again datacon has kept me busy with the large website. This website is very similar to the large drop </br>
                       down menu project that my classmates are recently doing.</li>
                       
                  <li> As a result, I think that I would be very successful because making this difficult datacon webpage,</br>
                       enable me to do more advance dropdowns, animations, etc... that would serve as an inspiration for </br>
                       future websites.</li>
                       
                  <li> Some problems that I had trouble solving included javascript slideshows and javascript animations. Through
                       </br> extensive research and trial and error, I was able to resolve a problem regarding the vairables </br>
                       that I specified the path and the amount of images taken.</li>
