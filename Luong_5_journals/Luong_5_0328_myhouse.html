                <li> The first step that I took to get a good head start was actually looking at the examples and see what</br>
                     each one does. Next, I started drawing rectangles and specifying the height, width, and coordinates on the </br>
                     canvas. Later, through trial and error/ "tinkering", I was able to figure out how to do multi-layer gradients. </br>
                     Then, after completing a basic house with a square structure and a triangular roof, I challenged myself by creating </br>
                     a particle system that I later learned how to attach to my house drawings. So, I first analyzed, create, tweak, and
                     then inovate.</li>
    
                <li> Some behaviors that lead to my success was that I had the patience to sit through a long time at home and figure out</br>
                     how to do a particle system with maxhealth, bounce, gravity, etc... In otherwords, commitment was a key factor.</br>
                     In addition, I was able to zone out and not get disrupted by my peers, which gives you time to think about your code.</li>
