        <p> Some of the things that I mastered on my emulation project included the exceptional usuage of different sections
            and div classes within my main class. Furthermore, I have mastered the use of images and creating links to multiple
            other webppages, including links that are really images. In addition, I have also mastered the effective usuage of 
            positioning, such as relative, fixed, and absolute, through the types of positions that I incorporated within each 
            individual images. I was proud of myself from continuing to strive for the "perfect" apple website because, in the 
            my emulation of the professional Apple website turned out to be very successful. ALthough I have mastered a bunch
            of new skills, I felt that I now have a truer understanding of the uses and functions of sections and divs. 
            Furthermore, I now know that it is possible to make different classes in almost every type of tag, such as a class
            for divs, sections, headers, paragraphs, etc... This project has enabled me to go beyond of what was expected.
