			<li>I didn't do yesterdays assignment because I was bussy doing the datacon website. However, if I were to do this assignment I think I would be very
			    </br> successful. </li>

			<li> This is because yesterdays assignment was directly coorelated to divs, positioning, css, background colors, and use of classes to create a basic review
			     </br> page. </li>

			<li> Some problems that I had on my datacon website was figuring out the reason why the student pages turned back to the original layout when I exited</br>
			     and returned to that page. It turns out that this is because the a tag was linked to the old website that was already in a domain. So, it turns out that
			     </br>my new layout will show every time if I create a domain and linking the pages towards it. Currently I am fixing and reorganizing the html and css
				</br> files.</li>
