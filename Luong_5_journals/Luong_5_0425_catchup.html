                <li>  I do not have any missing assignments because I always kept up to date. Any journals </br>
                      that required deeper analysis or thinking, I would think about at home and then </br>
                      finish the journals and then submit them. </br> </li>

                     best of my abilities at scholl while trying not to waste time. Then, I go home, think about it, </br>
                     and then finish the longer journals and submit them the next day in the week. </br> </li>
