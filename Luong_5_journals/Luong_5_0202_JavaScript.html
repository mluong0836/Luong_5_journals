                        <li> Javascript is a programming language for html and the web which specifically moniteres the behavior of the website. Therefore, JavaScript </br> 
                             is a more sophisticated language than css, but it can do much more. For instance, you can create slideshows that have a more authentic </br>
                             appeal rather than the appear and disappear background pictures in css. In addition, we can use JavaScript for flipping divs when a </br>
                             certain page is opened, therefore, providing more control over the websites. In otherwords, you can program things. </li>

                        <li> We can connect a javascript webpage into our main webpage by linking it to our main html page using a script tag. For example, we put <script src" and the
                             actual javascript page"></script> </li>
                </ol>
