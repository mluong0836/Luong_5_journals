                    <li> Some challenges that I have faced while emulating the program included trying to link an image to a new web page, getting the alternating colors to successfuly work, creating
                         a bottom table line, and creating a well spaced out navigation bar. I had a hard time figuring these things out because I didn't know the type of syntax used, since some of these
                          professional webpages have some features that I don't know yet. </li>
                    
                    <li> I have figured out how to create an anchor tag within an image, how to alternate the background colors, creating a well spaced out navigation bar, and creating an image
                         and multiple div tags within a main section. </li>

                    <li> I have learned how to create images and add a search bar that will take you to a new web page within my professional webpage. Furthermore, I have learned ssome new features like
                         that you are able to create a div class in almost every tag, which helped me create a long line across my header. Through tinkering and help, I have learned the uses of the 
                         different kinds of positions, like relative, absolute, and fixed all contributing to my final web page. </li>
