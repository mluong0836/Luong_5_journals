		<p> Some problems that I have faced includes implementing a counter in my game to limit the player's tries. In addition, I also had problems replaying the game once
			the player loses all his turns. It turns out that I couldn't make a separate else if statement because the program would read if it is greater than or equal
    			to the magicnumber, therefore never looking whether or not the player has lost all his counters. I fixed the problem by creating several if and else statements
			 within the main if statments to detect if the number was larger or less than and whether or not the loayer has lost all his/her turns. Furthermore, I was able
			 to resolve the conflict on why it wouldn't print out the alert for saying that you win. It turns out that my while loop detects right when the guess
			number and the magicnumber was equal to to exit. SO, you needed a separated if statement outside the while loop to detect if they won. Then, it will alert. </p>
