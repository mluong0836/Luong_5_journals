        <p> Today I could not access Codecademy because the web was under maintenance, as a result I was </br>
        was prepared to work on my responsive layout webpage, since I wanted to edit my mobile and tablet </br>
        version to my interest. In addition, I wanted to add a flip effect on the games page, so that when </br>
        viewer hovers over the div, there will be a flip animation that shows a hidden div, which represents </br>
        the back of the parent div. In other words, this linked back to our portals game in which we used parent </br>
        and child divs to animate multiple divs that are nested in one another. In the end, I am almost done with </br>
        a more authentic looking responsive webpage. </p>
        
        <p> I accomplish new css skills in flipping ivs to reveal a "backside" which is really a hidden child div. </br>
        In addition, I was successful in figuring out how to take advantage of the css hidden visibility element, </br>
        allowed me to add more stuff on the desktop viewport while limitimg on the amount of info on the mobile and tablet</br>
        versions of the web pages. </p>
