            <p> I am on the microbes animations so far. I have already finished the Pendulum, Gears, brick fall, </br>
                and clock. I was able to reach this far because I was able to focus on typing the provided codes. </br>
                In addition, I was able to reach this far because I tinkered and fixed all of the typos that could </br>
                easily been done because of the fast-paced environment. As a result, I was able to create fast, long, </br>
                and wiggling micobes in a "hairball" through analyzing the finished code and editting it to make it my</br>
                own. </br> </p>
