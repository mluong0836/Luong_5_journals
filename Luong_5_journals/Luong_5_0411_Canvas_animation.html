                <li> The process for creating images in Canvas is very simple. First, you need to </br>
                     get the html canvas id and give it the 2d context. Next, you simply draw a rectangle</br>
                     by putting ctx.rect(x-coordinate, y-coordinate, size, size); You would then fill the </br>
                     rectange with fillStyle = "color"; and then finally draw the rect by putting </br>
                     fillRect(x, y, size, size) of the filling space. As a result, this is similar when you want </br>
                     to draw complex images as well, just a slight variation of the code. You start with beginPath();</br>
                     and then type moveto(x,y) and then connect them with lineto(x, y). This will enable more complex shapes.</li>
                     
                <li> Based on my current knowledge of javascript and java from Computer Science, I think that constantly </br>
                     changing the location of the image will allow an animation to work. For instance, if you would want an </br>
                     image to bounce within a screen, you would create a variable that you would multiply for velocity, which </br>
                     changes the speed pattern of the bounce. Then, you also have a gravity variable controlling the pressure </br>
                     that is exerted. Furthermore, you would need several if and else statements that would detect if the image</br>
                     goes off the screen. If it does, just simply move the velocity/do the reciprocal function that was originally </br>
                     done. For example, if you did x += 5, yu would now change the property to x -=5.</li>
