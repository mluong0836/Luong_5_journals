			<li> The document object model (DOM) interacts with objects in HTML, XHTML, and XML documents and is a cross-platform language.</li>
			<li> It is important for web design because we generally use HTML files to generate our webpages. As a result, to make it more interactive</br>
			     we can take advantage of the DOM to interact with the objects we set though the id tags that we provided. The most basic </br>
			     components of web design is an additional linked css document. However, CSS can only do so much; thus, we rely on the DOM to provide </br>
     			     more authenticating interactions.</li>
			<li> It is especially important to javascript because DOM is the most used method in interacting with html elements. The document </br>
			     object model uses the get element by ID, which enables so much more functions that could be applied to that element. For instance, </br>
			     if you wanted to change the background color of an aside with an ID of player, you would call upon the get elemnt by id tag and specify</br>
			     what you want to happen. Here is a snippet:</li>

		<p> var change1 = document.getElementById("title");
		    change1.style.backgroundColor = '#f00'; </p>
