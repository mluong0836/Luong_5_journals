            <p> The animation that I am currently working on is the final combined animation project. A gallery of </br>
                all of my past animation projects displayed on a webpage. I was able to finish the Brickfall, Pendulum,</br>
                microbes, Gears, Clock, etc... I have created various animations and now will reveal what I have done on a </br>
                website of my choice. I was planning on making a monochromic purple home page, with 5 different webpages, </br>
                each with a different animation. THe individual webpages will also have purple, but will also have a blue </br>
                portrait-like div in the center in which the animation will be shown on top of. Therefore, I am trying to </br>
                accomodate what I have learned on HTML5, CSS, and Javascript; all of which well crafted into one good looking</br>
                website.</br> </p>
