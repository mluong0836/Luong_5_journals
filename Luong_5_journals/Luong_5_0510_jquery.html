            <p> jQuery is good for making more complicated and interactive websites through usuage of a javascript </br>
                library that already optimizes several functions that would have take a substantial line of javascript </br>
                code to accomplish the same task. Therefore, for more efficient and advanced websites, we would use </br>
                jQuery because it enables more interaction as the toggle, slide, fadeOut, etc... functions are readily </br>
                available with a couple of lines of code. Therefore, individuals use jQuery to enable a faster coding </br>
                environment, since jQuery is a javascript library that already has the multiple functions that we would </br>
                have to code if there wasn't a library available for it. So, advance websites need fewer lines of code, </br>
                who wouldn't want to use jQuery; thus, faster/build in optimization is why jQuery is used more than just </br>
                single handenly using javascript alone. Why work harder when there's a way to work faster? </br> </p>
