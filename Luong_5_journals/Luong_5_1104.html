			<li> The html creates the actual text within the website while the css creates the actual decorates, such as color, background color, font sizes, etc...
			     All the texts and images are incorporated within a box-shaped structure called the divs. Divs create the actual structure and organization of the website
			     for everything is incorporated within these box-shaped structures, which specify the height, width, and margins of the divs. So we can compare divs to 
			     to be the paragraphs that text are written in. The css are the decorations, like the colorful words written, and the html represent the actual text
			     written inside the divs. </li>
			<li> Html, css, divs, ids, and classes are used to create many aspects that are displayed by your webpage. Html represebnt the actual texts, css creates the 
			     decorations-like color-, divs, ids, and classes helps create the boundary or the actual area for the texts to be seen. Furthermore, classes and ids
			     help create a distinction or separation between the sections. For example, you can separate the main texts and sub-info using classes to create
			     a sense of distinction.
