                <li> The process for creating animations in canvas would be to request an animation frame. Then </br>
                     you would declare the animation frame with the draw function that you would want to animate.</br>
                     Within the animation frame, you should update the coordinates by adding, shubtracting, dividing, or</br>
                     multiplying with velocity to create movements. There is also a rotate function in javascript as well.</br></li>
                     
                <li> I am planning to create a moving light show of blue lines across a black screen. In addition, associated with</br>
                     this masterpiece will be a sort of shape rotating matrix that will appear to be the source of the light show. </br></li>
                     
                <li> The first function would be the update function, which will change the x and y coordinates, as well </br>
                     as the velocities of the rotations. In addition, another function would be the drawing method, which </br>
                     consists of the code to actually draw the multiple circles and lines that will rotate. The final function</br>
                     would be the interval function, which will delay the amount of rotations that the lines will perform </br>
                     within 25 seconds. </br></li>
