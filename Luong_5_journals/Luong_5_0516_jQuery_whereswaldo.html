            <p> I have some picture motifs that I have taken into consideration before deciding on my actual </br>
                image. I first thought of dogs because there are many kinds of dogs out there that can blend in </br>
                with the setting, since they have a variety of fur color and texture, suitable for camoflaugining.</br>
                Also, dogs are my favorite household pets as well. In addition, another motif that I was thinking was </br>
                the ocean and marine life. I was thinking of using an image of an ocean with many blue whales stacked on </br>
                top of the background. Therefore, the whales blend in the blue ocean setting and there are a variety of blue</br>
                whales in the world; thus, providing more challenges for the player to find the difference among these extremely</br>
                similar whales. In the end, I chose a whale because of the above reasons and that it reminds me of going to the beach, </br>
                which I have been longing to go, since winter. Therefore, there's a more meaningful purpose for this marine theme.</br> </p>
