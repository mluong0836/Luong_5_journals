                <li>I have acccomplished many things with my art. For instance, my House algorithm also had a particle </br
                    effect running along with the house. In addition, I now understand the parameters for the radial and </br>
                    linear gradients. For instance, the first two parameters are for location, the next two indicate the </br>
                    ending points of the center, and the last parameter, for a radial, indicates the z-coordinate(skewed).</br>
                    Furthermore, through creating this house, it helped strengthen my prior knowledge in canvas through CS. Although</br>
                    there were some differences, I noticed that there were a great amount of similarity between them. For example,</br>
                    the use of for loops to iterate through a series of integers, which indicate the number of times to perform the function.
                    </br> All in all, canvas in HTML5 provides a unique environment for designers to code their own algorithmic art.</li>
                    
                <li>My plan at first was to simply follow th rubric and create a decent house with a linear gradient sky, </br>
                    resembling a sunset view. However, I started thinking about how to incorporate animations within my house. </br>
                    At first, I was thinking of twinkling starts that would glimmer and rotate. However, I then remembered how </br>
                    I was unable to make a particle system in my Slick game in Computer Science. As a result, I tried fixing this </br>
                    failure by creating a Javascript particle effect. First, you needed gravity and velocity to create a bouncing effect</br>
                    . Next, you needed a for loop to add a set number of particles within the animation function. When I did this, the screen </br>
                    was overwhelmed with all these particles. So, I figured that each should have a maxlife that would delete the </br>
                    individual particles once they hit a certain number thorugh a for loop as well. It might seem complicated, but by </br>
                    using prior knowledge on for loops, local variables, translations, timers, functions, and a little tinkering, </br>
                    I was able to get the end product that I desired.</li>
                    
                <li>I have discovered that the randomness in Algorithmic art is what makes it unique and fun to see. Many try </br>
                    to mark the specific items that they want to include, but in the end, they will soon realize that with a couple </br>
                    of for loops, shapes, colors, and number switching, you would be able to create a factual art that would </br>
                    make you feel like an artist, even though you just simply played around with code to create algorithms(rules) </br>
                    and end up with a sort of random visual effect that is appealing to the viewers.</li>
